This fork of Zombie Survival intends to replicate the experience of an older version of the gamemode. Certain qol changes from the new gamemode will be kept.

# Changes
- Removed all new weapons from the arsenal (They still exist in the files so weapons in maps can still be given to players)
- Removed remantlers from the worth/arsenal.
- Removed all new zombies/bosses, evolutions. Simplified game, uncluttered class menu.
- Removed trinkets and reimplemented traits.
- Changed zombie hp/speed values back to what they were.
- Some custom weapons, can be removed if you want.
- Better balancing against bots on singleplayer/low population servers
- Made shade only able to be damaged by flashlights again
- Reverted arsenal crate/worth menu graphics
- Reverted to old font
# To do:
- Make bonemesh able to climb to counter survivors in high places
