This fork of Zombie Survival intends to replicate the experience of an older version of the gamemode. Certain qol changes from the new gamemode will be kept.

# Changes (planned, not implemented so far)
- Remove all new weapons from the arsenal (but keep them in the files so weapons in maps can still be given to players)
- Remove all new zombies/bosses, evolutions. Simplify game, unclutter class menu.
- Remove trinkets and reimplement traits (they aren't totally gone.)
- Change zombie hp/speed values back to what they were.
- Some custom weapons, can be removed if you want.
- Better balancing against bots on singleplayer/low population servers
- Make bonemesh able to climb to counter survivors in high places
- Make shade only able to be damaged by flashlight again
- Revert arsenal crate/worth menu graphics
- Revert to old font
